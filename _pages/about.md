I spend as much time as I can walking in the fields and woods of Canada. The English language often falls short in describing the natural world, but I find great joy in trying to bridge that gap. My two greatest loves are writing and biology, and my writing is the best way that I know how to communicate the wonderous world we live in to as many as people as possible. I want the whole world to know about the softness of milkweed silk, sharp scent of wintergreen, and the marvel of holding a tiny chorus frog in cupped palms.

My experience with science is another asset to my ability to communicate such things. The truth of the world is remarkable, and scientific papers communicate that truth with an efficiency that can seldom be matched. However, something is lost in the data and jargon of science journals. It takes years of practice and training to be able to translate the information found in such papers into something a human can understand. At its best, science is a bridge of understanding, but in our pursuit of efficiency, we have built a wall. I have the training and practice to climb that wall, and I have the skills needed to help people see the world as it truly is and, in doing so, help them to care about the wonderous world we live in.

If you ask someone if they care about “Spilomyia longicornis,” they are likely to say that they do not know what it is. How is anyone meant to care about something they do not know? However, if you tell them about the flies that have no stingers yet appear as remarkable imitations of wasps, they listen. They smile when you tell them about the way it waggles its wings and hold out its forelegs like a pair of long, waspish antennae, as if it is saying “I am a wasp, and you should not eat me!” A connection is made, and instead of an unfamiliar Latin name, suddenly Spilomyia longicornis is something worth caring about. 



Master of Science, knowledge of the scientific method
======
My time in university, and as a member of Tom Sherratt’s research team at Carleton University, have given me excellent insight into how science is conducted and the methods that are used. I have hands-on experience in developing and conducting experiments, analysing data, and writing up results. I’m even quite good at it! This has given me essential skills in interpreting scientific writings and coming to conclusions about the true state of the world. To say that one has “mastered” science makes me laugh, as any expert will tell you that there is always so much more to learn, but I have honed the skills required to view the world through a scientific lens, as well as to understand the words of those who have similar training. It has also given me excellent experience in project management, coding, effective budgeting, and completing all of these tasks in a quick and efficient manner.
