Writer
======
I started writing when I was ten years old, with visions of fantasy novels and book deals filling my dreams. Since then, I have amassed well over one million words of work in the English language, including nonfiction, fiction, scientific writing, and poetry. I am a prolific writer with a high standard for my work and a strong desire to constantly improve. Even though I have a great love for science, I am a writer at heart. I hope this portfolio, containing only a small sample of my work, helps you understand my styles of writing and my potential in this field. 

Master of Science, knowledge of the scientific method
======
My time in university, studying biology and working as a member of Tom Sherratt’s research team, has given me valuable insights into how science is conducted and a deep understanding of the methology of research. I have hands-on experience in developing and conducting experiments, analysing data, and writing up results. I’m even quite good at it! This has given me essential skills in interpreting scientific writings and coming to conclusions about the true state of the world. I have honed the skills required to view the world through a scientific lens, as well as to understand the words of those who have similar training. It has also given me excellent experience in project management, coding, effective budgeting, and managing my time wisely to complete my work.
